Allows the user to build a numerological profile and let the numbers speak about it.

## Project Description

This application will take the user through a profile building exercise.  During the process, the user may learn something factual along the way and see how numbers can have more meaning than simply to count, measure, or label something.

## API and Data Sample

Numbers API returns data arrays with trivial or factual information based on the parameter entered by the user.  In this example, the request returns an array of songs.  

i.e. numbersapi.com/8/year?json
```
{
 "text": "8 is the number of bits in a byte.",
 "number": 8,
 "found": true,
 "type": "trivia"
}
```
